A test project for a **SkillFactory** task: to write a *ChatServer* for net chats.

1. Server has to allow several users to connect simultaneously.
2. When any user sends a message with *Enter*, this message is shown to all other users.
3. Server has to allow any user to disconnect: existing users may continue to chat and new users may connect.
